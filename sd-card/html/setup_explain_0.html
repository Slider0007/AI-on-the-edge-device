    <h2>Welcome to the setup of the AI-on-the-Edge Device</h2>

    <p><img src="flow_overview.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="auto"></p>
    <p>
        This is the first time you started the device after the initial installation. You have been automatically routed to the <b>initial setup procedure</b>.
        With the prodecure the basic setup of your device within seven steps will be performed. After completion of all steps the setup mode will be completed
        and the device restarts automatically to the regular web interface.<br>
        Note: All settings of the initial setup will be also accessible using regular web interface.
        See documentation: <a href=https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/initial-setup target=_blank>Initial setup procedure</a> for additional explanations.
    </p>
    <p> You can navigate forward and backward during the setup with the buttons "Next Step" and "Previous Step".<br>
        With the button "Abort Setup" the setup will be skipped and abort screen will be presented.<br>
        To restart the setup process, push the button "Restart Setup".
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an overview over the seven steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Adjust <b>lens focus</b> and check for <b>reflections of flashlight</b><br>
        Ensure you camera lens has proper focus to object and flashlight do not create any distoring reflections.</p></li>
    <li><p>Creation of the <b>reference image</b><br>
        This image is used as base image to allow positioning of alignment marker, digit and analog ROIs.</p></li>
    <li><p>Defintion of <b>alignment marker</b>.<br>
        They are used to perform an orientation alignment of the camera image before further processing.</p></li>
    <li><p>Definition of <b>number sequences</b><br>
        A number sequence contains digit and/or analog ROIs which will be processed together to get a reading result.<br></p></li>
    <li><p><b>Setup Completion:</b> Complete / abort setup mode<br>
        In the final step the setup mode needs to be properly terminated by pushing the button on this page.<br>
        NOTE: This is important, otherwise the setup mode is recalled again after reboot.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>

<p>Please be patient when switching to another step. The device takes some time to load all needed information!</p>
